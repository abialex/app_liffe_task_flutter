# üåê **Responsive Web Project for Activities**

This project is a responsive web application designed for users to:

- **Filter activities by categories.**
- **Join activities if vacancies are available.**
- Fully compatible with mobile and desktop devices, providing a smooth and modern user experience.

---

## üöÄ **Main Features**

1. **Clean Architecture:**  
   The project is divided into layers (`modules`, `database`, `config`, `common`) to ensure modularity, maintainability, and reusability.

   - Reusable widgets designed with the **Atomic Design** methodology.

2. **State Management with BLoC and Cubit:**  
   Implemented BLoC to efficiently handle state management and ensure a clear separation between business logic and UI.

3. **Responsive Design:**  
   Used **`LayoutBuilder`** to dynamically adapt widgets based on screen size, enabling seamless transitions between web and mobile views.

4. **Performance Optimization:**  
   Elevated the BLoC to the module level to maintain local states when switching between web and mobile views, improving performance.

5. **Problem-Solving:**  
   Solved an initial issue with changing `BottomNavigationBar` colors by encapsulating it within a **`MaterialApp`**, isolating theme changes.

6. **Final Results:**

   - Users can only join activities if vacancies are available.
   - The application is fully responsive, offering an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

7. **Future Improvements:**
   - Implement **dark mode** for a more personalized and modern user experience.
